Его корни уходят в один фрагмент классической латыни 45 года н.э., то есть более двух тысячелетий назад. Ричард МакКлинток, профессор латыни из колледжа Hampden-Sydney, штат Вирджиния, взял одно из самых странных слов в Lorem Ipsum, \"consectetur\", и занялся его поисками в классической латинской литературе. В результате он нашёл неоспоримый первоисточник Lorem Ipsum в разделах 1.10.32 и 1.10.33 книги \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (\"О пределах добра и зла\"), написанной Цицероном в 45 году н.э. Этот трактат по теории этики был очень популярен в эпоху Возрождения. Первая строка Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", происходит от одной из строк в разделе 1.10.32<br><br></div><div>Классический текст Lorem Ipsum, используемый с XVI века, приведён ниже. Также даны разделы 1.10.32 и 1.10.33 \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" Цицерона и их английский перевод, сделанный H. Rackham, 1914 год.<br><br></div>", "all_tags"=>"ruby"}, "commit"=>"Изменить статью", "id"=>"11"}

Его корни уходят в один фрагмент классической латыни 45 года н.э., то есть более двух тысячелетий назад. Ричард МакКлинток, профессор латыни из колледжа Hampden-Sydney, штат Вирджиния, взял одно из самых странных слов в Lorem Ipsum, \"consectetur\", и занялся его поисками в классической латинской литературе. В результате он нашёл неоспоримый первоисточник Lorem Ipsum в разделах 1.10.32 и 1.10.33 книги \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (\"О пределах добра и зла\"), написанной Цицероном в 45 году н.э. Этот трактат по теории этики был очень популярен в эпоху Возрождения. Первая строка Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", происходит от одной из строк в разделе 1.10.32<br><br></div><div>Классический текст Lorem Ipsum, используемый с XVI века, приведён ниже. Также даны разделы 1.10.32 и 1.10.33 \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" Цицерона и их английский перевод, сделанный H. Rackham, 1914 год.<br><br></div>"], ["updated_at", "2021-09-21 13:15:00.213566"], ["id", 3]]

Lorem Ipsum не только успешно пережил без заметных изменений пять веков, но и перешагнул в электронный дизайн.

Его корни уходят в один фрагмент классической латыни 45 года н.э., то есть более двух тысячелетий назад. Ричард МакКлинток, профессор латыни из колледжа Hampden-Sydney, штат Вирджиния, взял одно из самых странных слов в Lorem Ipsum, \"consectetur\", и занялся его поисками в классической латинской литературе. В результате он нашёл неоспоримый первоисточник Lorem Ipsum в разделах 1.10.32 и 1.10.33 книги \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (\"О пределах добра и зла\"), написанной Цицероном в 45 году н.э. Этот трактат по теории этики был очень популярен в эпоху Возрождения. Первая строка Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", происходит от одной из строк в разделе 1.10.32<br><br></div><div>Классический текст Lorem Ipsum, используемый с XVI века, приведён ниже. Также даны разделы 1.10.32 и 1.10.33 \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" Цицерона и их английский перевод, сделанный H. Rackham, 1914 год.<br><br></div>", "all_tags"=>"ruby, css, javascript, php"}, "commit"=>"Изменить статью", "id"=>"11"}
