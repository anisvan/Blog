Его корни уходят в один фрагмент классической латыни 45 года н.э., то есть более двух тысячелетий назад. Ричард МакКлинток, профессор латыни из колледжа Hampden-Sydney, штат Вирджиния, взял одно из самых странных слов в Lorem Ipsum, \"consectetur\", и занялся его поисками в классической латинской литературе. В результате он нашёл неоспоримый первоисточник Lorem Ipsum в разделах 1.10.32 и 1.10.33 книги \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (\"О пределах добра и зла\"), написанной Цицероном в 45 году н.э. Этот трактат по теории этики был очень популярен в эпоху Возрождения. Первая строка Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", происходит от одной из строк в разделе 1.10.32<br><br></div><div>Классический текст Lorem Ipsum, используемый с XVI века, приведён ниже. Также даны разделы 1.10.32 и 1.10.33 \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" Цицерона и их английский перевод, сделанный H. Rackham, 1914 год.<br><br></div>", "all_tags"=>"ruby"}, "commit"=>"Изменить статью", "id"=>"11"}

Его корни уходят в один фрагмент классической латыни 45 года н.э., то есть более двух тысячелетий назад. Ричард МакКлинток, профессор латыни из колледжа Hampden-Sydney, штат Вирджиния, взял одно из самых странных слов в Lorem Ipsum, \"consectetur\", и занялся его поисками в классической латинской литературе. В результате он нашёл неоспоримый первоисточник Lorem Ipsum в разделах 1.10.32 и 1.10.33 книги \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (\"О пределах добра и зла\"), написанной Цицероном в 45 году н.э. Этот трактат по теории этики был очень популярен в эпоху Возрождения. Первая строка Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", происходит от одной из строк в разделе 1.10.32<br><br></div><div>Классический текст Lorem Ipsum, используемый с XVI века, приведён ниже. Также даны разделы 1.10.32 и 1.10.33 \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" Цицерона и их английский перевод, сделанный H. Rackham, 1914 год.<br><br></div>"], ["updated_at", "2021-09-21 13:15:00.213566"], ["id", 3]]

Lorem Ipsum не только успешно пережил без заметных изменений пять веков, но и перешагнул в электронный дизайн.

Его корни уходят в один фрагмент классической латыни 45 года н.э., то есть более двух тысячелетий назад. Ричард МакКлинток, профессор латыни из колледжа Hampden-Sydney, штат Вирджиния, взял одно из самых странных слов в Lorem Ipsum, \"consectetur\", и занялся его поисками в классической латинской литературе. В результате он нашёл неоспоримый первоисточник Lorem Ipsum в разделах 1.10.32 и 1.10.33 книги \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (\"О пределах добра и зла\"), написанной Цицероном в 45 году н.э. Этот трактат по теории этики был очень популярен в эпоху Возрождения. Первая строка Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", происходит от одной из строк в разделе 1.10.32<br><br></div><div>Классический текст Lorem Ipsum, используемый с XVI века, приведён ниже. Также даны разделы 1.10.32 и 1.10.33 \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" Цицерона и их английский перевод, сделанный H. Rackham, 1914 год.<br><br></div>", "all_tags"=>"ruby, css, javascript, php"}, "commit"=>"Изменить статью", "id"=>"11"}

These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.\"</div>", "all_tags"=>"html, javascript", "image"=>#<ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile:0x00007f6a8c540d78 @tempfile=#<Tempfile:/tmp/RackMultipart20210922-8239-m08os3.jpg>, @original_filename="I1KjV1QLb6Y.jpg", @content_type="image/jpeg", @headers="Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"post[image]\"; filename=\"I1KjV1QLb6Y.jpg\"\r\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\r\n">}, "commit"=>"Изменить статью", "id"=>"17"}

  Parameters: {"authenticity_token"=>"[FILTERED]", "post"=>{"title"=>"Что такое Lorem Ipsum?", "summary"=>"Lorem Ipsum - это текст-\"рыба\", часто используемый в печати и вэб-дизайне.", "body"=>"<div><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> - <em>это текст-\"рыба\", часто используемый в печати и вэб-дизайне. </em><em><del>Lorem Ipsum</del></em><em> является стандартной \"рыбой\" для текстов на латинице с начала XVI века. В то время некий безымянный печатник создал большую коллекцию размеров и форм шрифтов, используя Lorem Ipsum для распечатки образцов. Lorem Ipsum не только успешно пережил без заметных изменений пять веков, но и перешагнул в электронный дизайн. Его популяризации в новое время послужили публикация листов Letraset с образцами Lorem Ipsum в 60-х годах и, в более недавнее время, программы электронной вёрстки типа Aldus PageMaker, в шаблонах которых используется Lorem Ipsum.</em><figure data-trix-attachment=\"{&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;filename&quot;:&quot;27123223.jpg&quot;,&quot;filesize&quot;:514047,&quot;height&quot;:1200,&quot;previewable&quot;:true,&quot;sgid&quot;:&quot;BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSIxZ2lkOi8vYmJsb2cvQWN0aXZlU3RvcmFnZTo6QmxvYi8xP2V4cGlyZXNfaW4GOwBUSSIMcHVycG9zZQY7AFRJIg9hdHRhY2hhYmxlBjsAVEkiD2V4cGlyZXNfYXQGOwBUMA==--7cad2dcd0519b7ec2502328c9315c3bcca339bee&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://localhost:3000/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCZz09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--644254264e440aa21a454a7300e8612ac02eb9f2/27123223.jpg&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:1920}\" data-trix-content-type=\"image/jpeg\" data-trix-attributes=\"{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;ghfghgfh&quot;,&quot;presentation&quot;:&quot;gallery&quot;}\" class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--jpg\"><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCZz09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--644254264e440aa21a454a7300e8612ac02eb9f2/27123223.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1200\"><figcaption class=\"attachment__caption attachment__caption--edited\">ghfghgfh</figcaption></figure></div>", "all_tags"=>"ruby, css, go", "image"=>#<ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile:0x00007f72a465ce80 @tempfile=#<Tempfile:/tmp/RackMultipart20210922-3097-z9g4xx.JPG>, @original_filename="DSC00182.JPG", @content_type="image/jpeg", @headers="Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"post[image]\"; filename=\"DSC00182.JPG\"\r\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\r\n">}, "commit"=>"Изменить статью", "id"=>"7"}
